Welcome to the Blank Book

The Blank Book is an open-source project that allows users to create a book of there choosing, such as a passbook, an address book, or a phone book. This program will then sort the book based on whichever way the user wants it to be
sorted. The software will allow the user to enter multiple categories for each grouping to be sorted. (i.e. Name, Address) They can then choose to sort by whichever categories they made for example sorting by name or the town that
they live in.

This software when finished will be available to download for users to use on the app stores for Apple and Android.
